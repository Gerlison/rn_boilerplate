# REACT-NAVIGATION BOILERPLATE

A react-native template with essencial libraries, configurations and facilities for fresh projects.

## Motivation

I've created this template to facilitate the creation of fresh react-native projects. 
Every time I need to create a project, I need to set a lot of repeatitive configuration, like setup for redux, installation of dependencies, folder structure (and how it sucks), babel module resolver and eslint. To resolve it all, I developed this project, with that things preconfigured.

## Installing / Getting started

> I'm considering that you have a fully configured *react-native* environment.

A quick introduction of how to use the template.

```shell
npx @react-native-community/cli init ProjectName --template @gerlison/rn-boilerplate
```

That's all. Now you just need to install the dependendices and start coding. Follow *inital configuration* for instrunctions.

### Initial Configuration

You've just created your project, now to install all dependencies it requires, run:
```shell
cd ProjectName/
npm install
```
Ok, let's run the project
> For project runs properly, it requires an emulator or device connected.
```shell
react-native run-android
```


## Developing

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gerlison/rn_boilerplate.git
cd rn_boilerplate/template/
npm install
```

And state what happens step-by-step.

## Features

What's all the bells and whistles this project can perform?
* What's the main functionality
* You can also do another thing
* If you get really randy, you can even do this


#### Argument 1
Type: `String`  
Default: `'default value'`

State what an argument does and how you can use it. If needed, you can provide
an example below.

Example:
```bash
awesome-project "Some other value"  # Prints "You're nailing this readme!"
```

#### Argument 2
Type: `Number|Boolean`  
Default: 100

Copy-paste as many of these as you need.

## Contributing

When you publish something open source, one of the greatest motivations is that
anyone can just jump in and start contributing to your project.

These paragraphs are meant to welcome those kind souls to feel that they are
needed. You should state something like:

"If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature
branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome."

If there's anything else the developer needs to know (e.g. the code style
guide), you should link it here. If there's a lot of things to take into
consideration, it is common to separate this section to its own file called
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (or similar). If so, you should say that it exists here.

## Links

Even though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readable
format like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most useful
links to humans using your project. You can include links like:

- Project homepage: https://your.github.com/awesome-project/
- Repository: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/
- Issue tracker: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/issues
  - In case of sensitive bugs like security vulnerabilities, please contact
    my@email.com directly instead of using issue tracker. We value your effort
    to improve the security and privacy of this project!
- Related projects:
  - Your other project: https://github.com/your/other-project/
  - Someone else's project: https://github.com/someones/awesome-project/


## Licensing

One really important part: Give your project a proper license. Here you should
state what the license is and how to find the text version of the license.
Something like:

"The code in this project is licensed under MIT license."
